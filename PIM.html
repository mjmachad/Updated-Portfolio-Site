      <h1>Ontario Cannabis Store PIM Tool</h1>
      <p>
        The OCS PIM solution was a project proposal made to the Ontario Cannabis Store in February 2022. This project was geared towards allowing the OCS to receive and review new products that vendors submit.
        This solution was made to help streamline the process of getting products into their B2B portal, instead of the manual offline processes that occur today when submitting a product.
        This project enables the user to categorize the products into specific categories and subcategories to create a more organized and scalable tool.

        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>
          This project's objective was to develop a platform that would streamline the process for the OCS to receive and review new products before allowing it to be purchased by customers and retailers.
        </p>
        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          The intial challenge with this project was attempting to understand all requirements that were provided originally.To get started we analyzed each requirment and then began grouping them to identify what ahd similarities.
          Once that was complete the next challenge was trying to compelete a competitive analysis, however after conducintg our analysis there were not any existing designs to examine.
          As a result the lack of design references made this task very difficult and we had to rely on internal discussions to bring the business requirements to life.
          While developing the solution, working alongside another designer brought a couple of challenges because more communciation was needed to develop a consistent style guide to ensure that once the work was divided it would look consistent across the whole platform.
        </p>
        <h2>Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          At this time the PIM project is undergoing the developement phase and therefore mockups of the solution are unable to be provided at this time.
          Please check back once the project has been fully compelted.
